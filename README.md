# Teamspeak Music Bot - SaM


This code connects to a TeamSpeak server running on "127.0.0.1:10011", logs in as the server admin with the given password, and joins channel ID "1". The while True loop keeps the bot running indefinitely.

This code loads an MP3 file named music.mp3 and plays it using PyDub's play() function. You can modify this code to load and play different music files as desired.
