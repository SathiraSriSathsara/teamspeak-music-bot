In this version of the script, we use the "spotipy" library to access the Spotify API and retrieve the preview URL for the specified track or the first track in the specified playlist. We then use "youtube_dl" to download the audio from the preview URL and convert it to an MP3 file format that can be played by the pydub library. Finally, we use the TS3Server object to play the downloaded audio in the TeamSpeak channel. Note that you will need to replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with your own Spotify API credentials.
